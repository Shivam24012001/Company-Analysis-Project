# Business Data Analysis with Google Sheets

This project demonstrates the use of Google Sheets for business data analysis, showcasing skills in data organization, automation, and visualization.  It leverages several key Google Sheets features to provide dynamic and insightful analysis.

## Key Features

* **Conditional Formatting:**  Used to visually highlight key data points and trends, making it easier to identify areas of interest or concern.  *(Elaborate here on what you conditionally formatted, e.g., high/low turnover, etc.)*
* **Dynamic Dropdowns:** Implemented to allow for interactive filtering and analysis of the data.  Users can easily select specific criteria to view relevant subsets of the data. *(Specify what the dropdowns control, e.g., state, industry, etc.)*
* **Automated Calculations:**  Formulas and functions are used to automatically calculate key metrics, such as average turnover, total turnover, minimum turnover, and maximum turnover. This ensures accuracy and saves time. *(Mention specific formulas used if relevant, e.g., `AVERAGE`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`)*
* **Data Organization:** The data is structured and organized in a clear and logical manner, making it easy to understand and analyze.  *(Describe how the data is laid out in the sheet, e.g., columns for company name, state, turnover, etc.)*
* **Visualization:** Charts and graphs are used to visually represent the data, providing a clear and concise overview of key trends and insights.
